Penelope
Eiden

This is the basic plot of the story for the game. I havent written the story yet. I am not very skilled enough to write good romance sadly. So it will take a while

The story takes place in medieval times in some kingdom filled with mountains, oaks and pines. People made their livings with great difficulty.
The king there, was neglectful of his people. They struggled for food.

In a certain village, near the blue mountains. There lived a boy and a girl, Aiden and Penelope.
They liked each other very much. One day, small snow flakes started to fall in the village. The snow fall became stronger and turned into a storm.
Food was running low and there was no fire wood. One by one people started to die in the village. Not only the village but the whole kingdom was under the bitter winter.
Many of them didnt survive. Both the girl and the boy died.

(this is where the game begins)
Eiden woke up in the dungeons of the king's castle. Even the residents of the stone castle weren't able to survive.
They have seemed to have taken refuge in the dungeon fearing the angry mob whom the king had neglected.
They were revolting out of anger and hunger. The royal residents all died while starving in the dungeon fearing the mob.

The gist is that Aiden is currently in purgatory. There are two endings for the game. First normal ending is that Aiden escapes the dungeon and leaves the castle. He meets Penelope outside in the grass plains.
They spend their lives blissfully wandering in the plains for eternity. The second ending is that Aiden finds that the reason they are in purgatory is because of the King's stubborn desire to rule even after death.
He defeats the king, escapes out of the dungeon and meets Penelope in the plain. Then they go to heaven together after that.

Both the endings are happy endings. I dont like sad ends but the second one is what I would consider to be the 'true' one
